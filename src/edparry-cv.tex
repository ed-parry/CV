\section{INTERESTS}             
For as long as I can remember, I've had a genuine passion for computer science. I'm lucky enough to be part of a generation where learning about new technologies is almost instinct. Within the computer science field, I am highly enthusiastic about the Internet and it's development. Several modules within my Computer Science course have enabled me to understand how such a large scale network operates, and how to best utilise it to produce high quality websites and applications.

I have been a keen musician for many years now, playing the trumpet to ABRSM Grade 7 standard, and the piano to Grade 4. These have both given me the opportunity to develop new skills, build on my team working ability and to visit new places, having been on tours to France, Spain and Germany in recent years. Before attending university, I was a member of the Staffordshire North Youth Wind Orchestra and Staffordshire Moorlands Youth Jazz Orchestra.

When I manage to find spare time, I very much enjoy playing and watching a variety of sports. I am a keen member of the Aberystwyth Tennis Club, which despite often being a 1 vs. 1 game, requires a lot of team working to produce consistent results. I also enjoy cricket, and played at club level before leaving home.
